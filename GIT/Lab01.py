# Game introduction
msg "This is a 'guess a number' game"
    "You try to guess a randome number in the smallest number of attempts."
    "You were able to guess a number in" 
# Prompt the user for how difficult the game will be. Ask for an integer
value_max = input("Pick a positive integer")
print(value_max)
# Generate a random number between 1 and the chosen value
 value_random = random.randint(1, value_max)

# Give the user instructions as to what he or she will be doing

# Initialize the sentinal and the array of guesses

# Play the guessing game

    # Prompt the user for a number

    # Store the number in an array so it can be displayed later

    # Make a decision: was the guess too high, too low, or just right

# Give the user a report: How many guesses and what the guesses where
